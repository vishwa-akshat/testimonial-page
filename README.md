#testimonial-page

I recently completed my third challenge on [devchallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io), where I created a responsive Testimonial page using HTML and CSS. This project involved the following tasks:

1. **Create a Testimonial Page Matching the Given Design**: Built the structure based on the provided mockups.
2. **Use HTML for Basic Structure**: Included semantic elements.
3. **Add Heading, Body Text, and Checklists**: Followed design specifications for text and checklists.
4. **Add 2 Testimonial Cards**: Created cards with user feedback, names, and images.
5. **Style Cards with CSS**: Applied detailed styling for backgrounds, fonts, and colors.
6. **Ensure Responsiveness**: Used media queries for seamless display on all screen sizes.
7. **Deploy Solution**: Submitted the repository and live demo URLs.

Additionally, I included animations that trigger when the page loads to enhance the user experience.

This challenge was a great way to improve my frontend development skills.
